# Comparison between App Service and Virtual Machine for deploying a CMS app.

## Comparision
- ** Virtual Machine (VM): **
  - Cost: The cost of a VM is determined by the instance type and the duration it runs. It is relatively stable and does not change based on workload fluctuations.
  - Scalability: VMs do not scale automatically by default, you need to scale them manually or use tools like Scale Sets.
  - Availability: VMs do not provide high availability by default. You need to use Azure Availability Sets or Availability Zones to improve their availability.
  - Workflow: VMs require management of the operating system and patches.

- **Azure App Service:**
  - Cost: App Service is billed based on usage and scaling, making it more cost-effective for applications with variable or unpredictable traffic loads.
  - Scalability: App Service offers built-in auto-scaling features.
  - Availability: App Service provides built-in high availability by deploying applications across multiple regions.
  - Workflow: App Service manages the infrastructure, including the operating system and server management, so you only need to focus on the application itself.

## Justification

Since the application is simple with a small workload and does not have strict requirements on the application environment, I believe that App Service is a better choice for deploying it. With App Service, we can easily deploy the application without needing to configure the operating system. Since the workload is small, the cost will also be cheaper than using EC2.

## When to use VM

However, if the system has compliance or security requirements that necessitate further control over the infrastructure, such as installing specific host-level security tools, then VMs would be a better choice.
Also, if we are woking with lagacy system, then Vms will also be better

## 6. Conclusion
While **Azure App Service** is the best solution for most CMS deployment scenarios due to its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use, we would reconsider the choice if the applicationâ€™s needs evolve significantly, requiring higher levels of customization, control, or specific networking configurations. In such cases, a **Virtual Machine** may be more suitable for handling those demands.
